The **Sim4Life.lite** version is recorded in each project card once it is generated. If a newer version of **Sim4Life.lite** is released, a small circular arrow icon will appear at the bottom right corner of the card. The user can click on this icon to open a window showing the version numbers and allowing to update the project with the latest released version. 

Please refer to the section [Sharing and Publishing Projects](/docs/overview/dashboard/share.md) to learn how to share the simulation projects with other users. 

Once a project is opened in **Sim4Life.lite** platform, it is always possible to return to the Dashboard by clicking the ```Dashboard``` button on the top left corner. The current state of the project will be automatically saved.
